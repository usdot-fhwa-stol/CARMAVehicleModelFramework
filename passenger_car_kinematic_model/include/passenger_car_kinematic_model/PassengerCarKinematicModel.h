/**
 * @class PassengerCarKinematicModel
 * @brief Class which implements a kinematic vehicle bicycle model for front wheel drive passenger cars. This class treats the longitudinal velocity as the total vehicle velocity
 * 
 * This class is based on the kinematic model presented in (R. Rajamani, Vehicle Dynamics and Control. Springer, 2012.)
 * which was reformulated in 
 * (Polack, Philip & Altch√©, Florent & Novel, Brigitte & de La Fortelle, Arnaud. (2017).
 * The kinematic bicycle model: A consistent model for planning feasible trajectories for autonomous vehicles?. 812-818. 10.1109/IVS.2017.7995816.) 
 * 
 * The forumaltion was modified to compute the acceleration control input based on a proportional response to the error between current and target velocity
 * 
 * NOTE: This class does not support trailers at this time. The trailer angle will remain unchanged during integration
 *       Additionally, the lateral velocity will be set to zero
